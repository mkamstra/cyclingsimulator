# Cycling Simulator

This is an experiment (for now) to build a cycling simulator based on a service oriented architecture with Kafka intended to be used as the event queue. The idea is to build a simulator that can resemble real racing. Initially everything will be generated, but if things work out well it might develop into some kind of online game.
